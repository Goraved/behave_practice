# behave practice
Just a python [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) test runner practice

As usual I don't like BDD frameworks at all, cause you need to support additional layer of logic and map all the steps 
to the text feature files.

To be honest, I didn't have a troubles to start this PoC. Allure report integrated easily, setup/teardown logic also 
setup without any troubles, but write separate methods with text decorators for each step is so annoying.
